# My $HOME is my castle
My take on managing dotfiles and keeping them in sync across machines.
Contains:

- bash configuration that allows to customize settings per host and per os
- vim configuration based on pathogen
- solarized color theme for bash (including dircolors) and vim
- a setup script to quickly "move in" on new machines
